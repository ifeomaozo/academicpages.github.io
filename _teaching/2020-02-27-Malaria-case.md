As a guest-lecturer, I facilitated a graduate student case on the implementation of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Swaziland (Eswatini) to improve malaria case management and strengthen the national malaria surveillance system as part of the National Malaria Control Program's malaria elimination strategy. My lecture received the highest student engagement scores for the course quarter and I was given a letter of commendation by the Course Director.
