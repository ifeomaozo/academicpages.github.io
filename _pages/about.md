I am a Postdoctoral Fellow with the [Malaria Modeling Research Group](http://www.numalariamodeling.org) at Northwestern University. I lead survey data analysis and simulation modeling to assess the impact of malaria intervention mixes at finer spatial scales to inform national strategic planning in endemic countries. I also lead statistical modeling to understand urban-rural determinants of malaria tranmission. I am actively looking for Research Scientist roles in the pharmaceutical or public health space so feel free to reach out to me via email at ozodiegwui@gmail.com.

Prior to my postdoc, I applied traditional regression models and bayesian spatial models to [analyse the prevalence and context of adult female overweight and obesity in African countries](http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e268/97165b6eef2dce34009bc24b51a271005653.pdf), as part of my Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program, which I completed in 2019 from East Tennessee State University (ETSU). My research received several awards including a [Rotary International Global Grant](http://www.rotary7570.org/ItemDetails.aspx?DataItemID=oEjpXRE3cxo%3D).

### News on submitted manuscripts/manuscripts in prep 
* Our critique of the Demographic and Health surveys highlighting the gaps in the survey strategy and questions in relation to malaria was submitted to the _Malaria_ _Journal_. You can download the submitted draft [here.](http://ifeomaozo.github.io/files/DHS_opinion_piece.pdf).

* A first draft of our paper on the application of mathematical models of malaria transmission for fine-scale impact prediction is currently undergoing review and will be available on this website soon.

* A draft of a systematic review on the global implementation of the adverse child experiences surveys conducted as part of a collaborative project with colleagues at ETSU is available for download [here.](http://ifeomaozo.github.io/files/Systematic Review of ACEs_12-2-2020.pdf)


### Other Recent News
* Our impact prediction work was cited in the [ 2020 World Malaria Report](http://who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015791). Many thanks to everyone that contributed. 

* I have been invited to mentor graduate students for the WiDS Kaggle competition. I was a data science mentor last year and recieved this [letter of commendation](http://ifeomaozo.github.io/files/IDO_WiDS.pdf).

* I was once again invited to guest lecture the Graduate student Global Delivery Course at Northwestern's Institute for Global Health. I will be faciliating a malaria case study and discussing our malaria modeling work.
