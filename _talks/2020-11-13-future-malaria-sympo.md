In this talk, I discuss the analytical framework developed by my research group and our collaborators for predicting the impact of the NMEP’s proposed intervention strategy on malaria morbidity and mortality in each of Nigeria’s 774 local government areas (LGAs). Our framework was built on EMOD, an agent-based model of _Plasmodium_ _falciparum_ transmission, and incorporates survey data, routine data, and programmatic data from Nigeria.
