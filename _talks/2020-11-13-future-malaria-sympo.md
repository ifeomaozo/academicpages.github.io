In this talk, I discussed the analytical framework that we developed to predict the impact of the Nigeria's National Malaria Elimination Programme's proposed intervention strategy on malaria morbidity and mortality on each of the 774 local government areas. Our framework was built on EMOD, an agent-based model of _Plasmodium_ _falciparum_ transmission, and incorporates survey, routine, and programmatic data.
