For the 2020 – 2025 National Strategic Plan, the Nigerian Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP) developed a targeted approach to intervention deployment that considered spatial heterogeneity in malaria transmission at the local government level. In this talk, I discuss the analytical framework developed by my research group and our collaborators for predicting the impact of the NMEP’s proposed intervention strategy on malaria morbidity and mortality in each of Nigeria’s 774 local government areas (LGAs). Our framework was built on EMOD, an agent-based model of Plasmodium falciparum transmission, and incorporates survey data, routine data, and programmatic data from Nigeria.
